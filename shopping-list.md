2. Put your application code in a file called index.js and link to it in index.html.
3. Be sure to put both script elements at the bottom of the <body> element.
4. Do not alter index.html or main.css other than adding the links to the external JavaScript inside index.html. Write JavaScript code that works with the existing HTML and CSS to implement the required features.
